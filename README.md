# Unet

A PyTorch implementation of Unet. The model can be found in `unet.py` and an example of usage can be found in `unet.ipynb`.

## TODO

* Add requirements.txt
* Add drawings to explaining text
* Write decent training loop using ignite, early stopping, add TensorboardX etc
* Add proper evaluation
